I have cereated a simple calculator which does addition, subtraction, multiplication and divition based on the user input
First the program asks the user to input their first number
The they are asked to input their second number 
Then they input the sign based on what they want the program to perform is it addition, multiplication, subtraction or divition
Then the program shows output based on the user inputs
